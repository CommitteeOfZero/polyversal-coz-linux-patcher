# Verifying Patch Installation

Below you can find a list of the quickest ways to verify that the installation of each game's CoZ patch was successful.

Regardless of the specific game, do make sure upon launching from Steam that you are met with the black CoZ game launcher and not the (uglier) beige vanilla launcher.

As always, check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if it turns out that your game has in fact not been patched correctly.

## CHAOS;HEAD NoAH and CHAOS;CHILD

About what kind of the noids you get?

If the splash text on the title screen for these games has the word "noids" in it, the patch is **not** applied. For Chaos;Child, the patched title screen will additionally have the phrase "Delusional Science ADV" rather than the Japanese "妄想科学ADV".

Patched Chaos;Head NoAH screen:

![The patched C;HN title screen](/assets/verify/nonoids.jpg "No noids?")

Patched Chaos;Child screen:

![The patched C;C title screen](/assets/verify/choccybestboy.jpg "No noids.")

## STEINS;GATE and STEINS;GATE 0

These don't have any immediate tells except for the font being noticeably more readable, which might not be much help if you're not already familiar with how the unpatched font looks.

The patched font:

![S;G with the better font](/assets/verify/much-better.png "Lookin good.")

The unpatched font:

![S;G with the vanilla font](/assets/verify/ow-my-eyes.png "Ow, my eyes.")

Alternatively, you can idle on the title screen (before you "Press Any Button") and wait for the opening movie to play. The game is **patched** if the song has subtitles, provided you didn't disable them in the game's launcher.

## ROBOTICS;NOTES ELITE and ROBOTICS;NOTES DaSH

Try moving your mouse/trackpad around. Does a cursor show up? Good! The game is **patched**.

The R;N games unpatched do not have mouse support.

## ANONYMOUS;CODE

This patch has the least changes of all. The best way to verify that this is patched would likely be to idle on the title screen for about a minute and see if the opening movie has subtitles.

And remember, if your patch isn't applied you can always check the [page on troubleshooting](/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)!
