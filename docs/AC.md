# Anonymous;Code Setup

Upon release of the series' latest entry, video and audio playback were almost completely broken on Linux systems. The audio issue has since been fixed by the CoZ patch itself, and video playback has been fixed through the efforts of resident hackerchad [Hawkheart](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7083#issuecomment-1872481780) via a custom Proton build.

The Polyversal Patcher makes it easy to install this Proton version:

1. Run the polyversal patcher by double-clicking on `Polyversal.desktop`.

   - **Note**: if you get a prompt asking whether you want to "Run" or "Open" the file, choose "Run".

1. Choose "Install custom A;C Proton" (the GIF above is outdated) and follow the prompts.

   - **Note**: this file is a bit large and may take a while to download, depending on your internet speed.

1. Once the installation is complete, **restart Steam.** This is necessary for you to be able to choose this new Proton version from the game's settings.

And that's it! You can [return to the instructions](/README.md#setup) and pick up where you left off.
